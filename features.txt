User actions:
- User should be able to select between text models, image models and video models.
- Change should be with a simple @
- History of all chats
- Context should also switch between models (e.g. if i gave some conext to chatgpt, that should go to claude as well if I switch models)
- Login with email (one click ho toh sahi)
- Ensure generation doesn't stop mid-way
Good to haves:
- web search
- CSV upload and data analysis
- context setting (+ prompt marketplace link?)
